definition vangle where
  "vangle u v = (if u = 0 \<or> v = 0 then pi / 2 else arccos (u \<bullet> v / (norm u * norm v)))"
definition angle where
  "angle a b c = vangle (a - b) (c - b)"
definition coplanar where
  "coplanar S \<longleftrightarrow> (\<exists>u v. \<forall>x \<in> S. \<forall>y \<in> S. \<exists>c d. x - y = c *\<^sub>R u + d *\<^sub>R v)"
theorem putnam_1972_b5:
  fixes A B C D :: "real^3"
  assumes hnonplanar : "\<not> coplanar {A,B,C,D}"
    and hangles : "angle A B C = angle C D A \<and> angle B C D = angle D A B"
  shows "dist A B = dist C D \<and> dist B C = dist D A"
