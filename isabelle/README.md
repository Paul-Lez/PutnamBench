The Isabelle formalizations largely rely on the HOL Library, and are present in a problem-per-file format by default.

We also note that while the dependencies listed in each formalization are sufficient to *state* the problem, one may need further mathematical theory developed in Isabelle to write a proof. We do not believe this will be the case for many problems, but please do let us know if you have particular feedback on this or with any other concerns.
