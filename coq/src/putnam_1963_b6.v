Theorem putnam_1963_b6
    (T : Ensemble Tpoint -> Ensemble Tpoint := fun A => (fun r => exists p q, In Tpoint A p /\ In Tpoint A q /\ Bet p r q))
    (A : nat -> Ensemble Tpoint)
    (hA0 : (A 0) <> Empty_set Tpoint)
    (hAn : forall n : nat, n >= 1 -> A n = T (A (n - 1)))
    : (forall n : nat, n >= 2 -> A n = A (n + 1)).
